# Kasper Adaptation Project

This is a modern full-stack web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The goal of this project is to migrate and re-architect an enterprise .NET-based solution into a full-stack JavaScript ecosystem using **Next.js (React)** for the frontend and **Strapi (Headless CMS)** for the backend.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The **Kasper Adaptation Project** is designed to manage and administer transport routes, users, tickets, and other logistics operations through a centralized, responsive, and scalable web application.

This migration aims to:

- Modernize the development stack
- Improve frontend flexibility using React components
- Leverage Strapi for easy content and user management
- Demonstrate how enterprise-grade applications can be developed using JavaScript/TypeScript-based tools

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

### ðŸ”¹ Frontend

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **React 18**
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** â€“ Static typing
- **Axios** â€“ HTTP client for API requests
- **Context API** â€“ For client-side state management (Auth)

### ðŸ”¹ Backend

- **Strapi v4** â€“ Open-source headless CMS
- **JWT Authentication** â€“ Token-based auth
- **REST API** â€“ Used to fetch and manage resources

### ðŸ”¹ Dev Tools

- **ESLint & Prettier** â€“ Code linting and formatting
- **Vercel** â€“ Deployment and hosting
- **.env.local** â€“ Environment-specific configuration

## ðŸ§± Project Architecture

The project follows a **modular and maintainable structure**:

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

````text
/src
â”œâ”€â”€ /app         â†’ App router entry points & routes
â”œâ”€â”€ /components  â†’ Reusable UI components (e.g., Navbar, LoginForm, Table)
â”œâ”€â”€ /context     â†’ React Context for global state (e.g., AuthContext)
â”œâ”€â”€ /lib         â†’ Axios instance & API helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ /utils       â†’ Utility functions (e.g., tokenUtils, userUtils)
â”œâ”€â”€ /styles      â†’ Global styles (Tailwind & custom CSS)
â”œâ”€â”€ /pages       â†’ (If used) Legacy routing fallback
â””â”€â”€ /public      â†’ Static assets


- **Authentication** is managed using JWT tokens stored in localStorage.
- **API Communication** is centralized via a custom Axios instance that attaches the token to every request.
- **State Management** is done using Context API and custom hooks.
- **Dynamic and Static Rendering** is handled using `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` respectively.
