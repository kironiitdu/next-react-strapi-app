# Kasper Adaptation Project

This is a modern full-stack web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The goal of this project is to migrate and re-architect an enterprise .NET-based solution into a full-stack JavaScript ecosystem using **Next.js (React)** for the frontend and **Strapi (Headless CMS)** for the backend.
